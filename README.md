### The High Note Data

The data for High Note's case is real and comes from an actual online music-listening service; however, the business situation and the 'High Note' name are fictional inventions. Due to copyright considerations, we are permitted by the instructor to present only our analytical findings and insights (the notebook report) but not the raw dataset itself. The initial five rows (and some columns) of the dataset are shown in the report as part of the data inspection, for those interested in understanding the raw data structure and general composition. Please contact [professor Sinan Aral](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/sinan-aral) at MIT Sloan School of Management for inquiries regarding access to the underlying High Note Dataset.
